# spelunk-clj-irc

[n01se.net](http://clojure-log.n01se.net/) has been graciously capturing and hosting HTML copies of [Clojure IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/#clojure) logs. This code intends to screenscrape said logs, convert to simpler formats, and possibly even answer simple questions about the data.

## Usage

Very limited at the moment, tested only with local copies of the html files
(spelunk-clj-irc.core/dir-to-csv "/path/to/local/html_files/"))
